# Input: consists of three integers a,b,k, where 10**11 >= a,b >= 0,k > 0.
# The numbers a and b describe the left and right bounds of the interval, i.e.,
# the set {a, a+1,â€¦,b-1,b}
# Output: The output is a single integer r , which is the maximum
# amount of numbers you can delete when following the optimal strategy.
